# Miscelaneous
In this folder you will find some useful scripts and other software. This is not a part of LELAPE itself but it can help you to make its use easier. Every tool is inside a folder.

This is a list of the available tools:

* __BIN2CSV__: it compares two binary files, one uploaded to the configuration memory of an FPGA, the other downloaded after the irradiation, extracts the mismatchs between equivalent words and saves the information in CSV format, ready to be used by LELAPE.
