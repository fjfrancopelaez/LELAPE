# Miscelaneous
In this folder you will find some useful scripts and other software. This is not a part of LELAPE itself but it can help you to make its use easier. Every tool is inside a folder.

This is a list of the available tools:

* __BIN2CSV__: it compares two binary files, one uploaded to the configuration memory of an FPGA, the other downloaded after the irradiation, extracts the mismatchs between equivalent words and saves the information in CSV format, ready to be used by LELAPE. 
* __CATCSV__: it combines CSV from different rounds and generates a new CSV file with the contents of the individual files labeled as rounds of an hypothetical pseudostatic test.
* __SemIP__: it builds a CSV file from the log file got after using AMD Xilinx SemIP (Whatever this means!).
