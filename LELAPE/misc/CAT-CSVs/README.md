#CAT-CSV
Let us suppose that we have done several reading rounds and got individual CSV files. Perhaps, we consider it is interesting to consider them as rounds of a unique and longer pseudostatic test.

This script reads the CSV inside a folder, concatenates them and adds a round label for data in each file.

You can extract files from InputFiles.zip and test the script.
