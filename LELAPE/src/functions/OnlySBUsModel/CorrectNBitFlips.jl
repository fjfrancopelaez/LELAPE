function CorrectNBitFlips(NBF::Int, LN::Int)::Float64

    # Tries to correct the number of bitflips to compensate cells hit twice that
    # escape from inspection. 
    #
    # NBF: Number of bitflips. Theoretically, SBUs but they are impossible to be distinguished 
    #       from other kinds of bitflips. Therefore, a simple approach is taken.
    # LN: Memory size in BITS!!!!!
