function Classify_Addresses_in_MCU(DATA::Matrix{UInt32},

    ## The purpose of this function is to classify the addresses (or pseudoaddresses) with bitflips
    ## transform the matrix of INDEXES got from MCU_Indexes() into a Vector of matrices, called
    ## SOLUTION, which is eventually returned.
    ##  
    ## The length of SOLUTION is the size of the largest observed MCU(s), NLMCU. Thus, SOLUTION[1] is
    ## a N x NLMCU matrix in which every row contains the addresses or pseudoaddresses of the NLMCU
    ## bitflips involved in this MCU. N is the number of observdd NLMCU-bit MCUs.
    ## 
    ## SOLUTION[2] is devoted to events with M = NLMCU-1 bits. As before, it is a matrix with NLMCU-1 
    ## rows and an undetermined number of rows.
    ##
    ## Finally, SOLUTION[NLMCU] is just a simple vector with the addresses not involved in MCUs. Obviously,
    ## these are the SBUs.
    ##
