# This function used the original set of DATA, supposed to include 4 columns, the last of which containing
# the labels of the reading cycles, and detect the cycles where potential SEFIs have occurred.  
# 
#  The idea of this method is quite simple. Accepting that the cross section for any MCU is constant throughout the 
#  whole device and that the flux is homogeneous, the probability of a cell being fflipped is constant and extremely low.
#  Therefere, it is quite strange that a cell appears many times in the recorded DATA. It does not matter if the
#  cell is affected following an SBU or an MCU, since both phenomena are random, and differences appear only in the
#  difference-of-addresses set. 
#
# However, if there are SEFI, microlatchup, stuck bits, etc., a cell will many times more than expected. Hence, we will calculate
# the probability of occurrence with the function CombinedProbability, select the value CUTOFF for which
# this probability is lower than 0.001 (just line in SEFI_Detection_Binomial), and mark the addresses that too often appeared.

# Appendix:
# Let suppose that we have done an irradiation test in which there have being NC cycles and getting Nk bitflips in the cycle Sk.
# The probability of an address appearing several times is equivalent to those explaining the binomial distribution. The expressions
# are easy to obtain just multipliying the probability of a value being present in M especific values and absent in NC-M, and
# adding all the possible case. 
#
# However, this expressions are really hard to calculate. For simplicity, we suppose that all the cycles are equivalent with the 
# average probability p=NBitFlips/NC/L and making calculations. In this case, the probability of an element appearing M tiems being:

# P(0) = (1-p)^NC
# P(M) = NC*(NC-1)*...*(NC-M+1)*p^M*(1-p)^(NC-M)
#
