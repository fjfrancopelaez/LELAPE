This is the Trace Rule and, in our analyisis, we want to keep all those too often repeated elements such that contain 2 ones or less in binary format.\n",

Therefore, to help the software and to avoid running out of memory, we will say the program _\"Don't be silly and do not expect events larger than 20!!\"_ If somehow this idea was wrong, we can change this value again and repeat the calculations."
