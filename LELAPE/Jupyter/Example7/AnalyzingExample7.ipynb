    "In this example, we are investigating the bitstream of an FPGA. Its size is 955,760x32 = 30,584,320, containing 25,479,936 bits of configuration memory, 131,072 flip-flops, and 4,973,312 bits of BRAM. A golden file following the manufacturer's rules was uploaded on the FPGA and then irradiated in static mode in an only round. Later, the content was downloaded and compared with the initial file. Although we can split the raw bitstream in three sets thanks to some reverse engineering, we have preferred not to do that in order to force the tool to do its best."
